# chiplet-aware-qiskit

Custom_Backend: This folder contains the backend generator code, the original backend file, and the files generated by the Python program.

Custom_Gate_Files: This folder contains the Python files we need to change to apply the custom gate. It also includes an example backend that supports the custom gate.

The two main files are used to generate the example circuit with corresponding methods for fixing the alignment. The fake_chiplet file allows us to load the backend into Qiskit.
